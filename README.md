# Homework 1

# Overview
In this assignment, you'll reflect on some differences between Java and C++ and practice some of the memory models we saw in class. You'll also work (or fight?) with the C++ compiler as you dive into compiler errors, as well as read, modify, compile, execute, and test some C++ code. As you will see in the Issues, this assignment includes both written and coding parts. 

To get the starter code, check out the `develop` branch of your assignment repository to your work space: 
`git clone -b develop <path_to_your_repo>`. To find the git path to your assignment repository, click the green "Clone or Download" button and copy the url that appears.


# Reading
Before you begin, you should look at the following readings:
* Chapter 1 through Section 1.4 and Sections 3.1-3.2 of the *C++ Primer, 5th Edition*. You may also find Section 2.1 to be a helpful reference. 
* The [Homework 1 clarifications](https://cs.hmc.edu/cs70/wiki/HW01-Clarifications) wiki page, where we will collectively accumulate clarifications and useful advice for the assignment. You should definitely check this before you start the assignment, and may want to check back periodically (especially if you're having trouble with something in the assignment). 

Note that you will also be finding a lot of your own online resources as you complete this assignment. 

# Grading
Your submission will be graded as follows: 
* 20 points: correctness
* 15 points: completeness
* 10 points: clarity 
* 5 points: peer review

The written portion of the homework is worth 20 of these 50 points.  

See the [Grading Guidelines](https://cs.hmc.edu/cs70/wiki/Grading-Guidelines) wiki page for more information about what we're looking for in each of those categories. 



# Resources 
* See the *[GitHub How To](https://cs.hmc.edu/cs70/wiki/Setting-Up-Your-Repository) wiki page* for details on how to set up this assignment. 
* The repository for this assignment includes code in Python, Java, and C++. Before you start the Coding part, you should confirm that you can compile and run the Java and C++ versions of the `palindrome` code. Review the [Compiling Code](https://cs.hmc.edu/cs70/wiki/CompilingHowTo) wiki page for details on how to do that. You don't have to submit anything for this part, but in future assignments we will assume you know how to compile and run C++ code.
* Help each other out! If you have resources or tips for other teams, add them to the [Clarifications](https://cs.hmc.edu/cs70/wiki/HW01-Clarifications) page for this assignment. 

# Helpful Hints
* *Pair Programming:* Remember, you must work on coding and writing tests as a pair.  You can (and should) read this assignment writeup and think about it before you meet, however.
* *Commit Early, Commit Often:* Remember to check in your files regularly!  In particular, don't forget to check them in when you're finished.
* As a general rule (even outside CS 70!), *you should not add generated files* of any form (e.g., compiled code, PDFs made from LaTeX, etc) to a repository when those files can be automatically produced from files already in the repository. 
* *Doxygen:* The C++ files are commented in `Doxygen` format. `Doxygen` is a tool that can automatically generate HTML or LaTeX documentation from C++ files. In future assignments, we will ask you to write your own Doxygen comments and to use Doxygen to generate documentation. For now, it's important only that you keep all the comments in your code up to date. You don't need to worry too much about the format of Doxygen comments in your code, nor do you need to generate Doxygen documentation.
